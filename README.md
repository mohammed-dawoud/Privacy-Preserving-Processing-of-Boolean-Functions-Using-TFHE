# Privacy-Preserving-Processing-of-Boolean-Functions-Using-TFHE
a solution that enables the execution of Boolean functions on sets of binary vectors in a reduced space while maintaining privacy.
This solution is designed to execute Boolean functions on sets of binary vectors within a reduced space while ensuring privacy preservation. Leveraging logical zonotopes as a novel set representation, capable of representing up to 2ùõæ binary vectors using only ùõæ generators, enables the execution of Boolean functions in the reduced space of logical zonotopes, i.e., the generator space. To ensure the privacy of sets throughout the computation process, the proposed solution utilizes the TFHE, which offers a fast gate-by-gate bootstrapping approach for evaluating arbitrary Boolean circuits in the encrypted domain.
