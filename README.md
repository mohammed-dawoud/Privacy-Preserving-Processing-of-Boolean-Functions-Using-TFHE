# Privacy-Preserving-Processing-of-Boolean-Functions-Using-TFHE
A solution that enables the execution of Boolean functions on sets of binary vectors in a reduced space while maintaining privacy. This solution is an implementation for the approach presented in our paper titled <b>Privacy-Preserving Execution of Boolean Functions and
Intersections Using Constrained Polynomial Logical Zonotopes</b>.
This solution is designed to execute Boolean functions on sets of binary vectors within a reduced space while ensuring privacy preservation. Leveraging constrained polynomial logical zonotopes as a novel set representation, capable of representing up to 2^ùõæ binary vectors using only ùõæ generators, enables the execution of Boolean functions in the reduced space of constrained polynomial logical zonotopes, i.e., the generator space. To ensure the privacy of sets throughout the computation process, the proposed solution utilizes the TFHE, which offers a fast gate-by-gate bootstrapping approach for evaluating arbitrary Boolean circuits in the encrypted domain.

#Dependencies
To run the code on your device you need to install the following:
1. [MatLab](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html)
2. [CORA Tool Box](https://tumcps.github.io/CORA/)
3. [Fast Fully Homomorphic Encryption Over Torus](https://tfhe.github.io/tfhe/)
The experiment was run on Ubuntu 22.04.5 LTS, CORA 2022, and MatLab 2023b. However, it would be fine if you had higher editions.
# How to run
1. Make sure you can use the TFHE APIs within MatLab,i.e., you can include the paths within MatLab
3. Download the repository
4. Add the CORA toolbox and the downloaded repo to your MatLab path
5. You can simply modify the TFHE_TestConPolyLogicalFunctions.m file to test the different APIs provided for the privacy-preserving Boolean functions and intersection
